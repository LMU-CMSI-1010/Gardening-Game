Welcome to our Flower Pot Game!

In this game, you take on the role of a gardener attempting to make money by selling their plants. But before you can sell them, you have a plant seeds,
fertilize, and water them.

Each pot on the ground will flash a warning that lets the player know which tool they need to use on that particular plant. All the user needs to do is click on the 
appropriate tool and then the pot that they are trying to use that tool on and repeat!

Once the plant is done growing (when all the tools have been used on the plant), the plant is ready to be sold! Just click on the sell icon and the potted plant that's
ready to be sold and then voila! The plant has been sold and you earn a point. Keep repeating this process to get a higher score!
